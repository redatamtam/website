<h6><u>Abstract</u>: The spatial concentration of talent is a robust pattern of modern economies. While the sorting of individuals into cities beget regional disparities, it may benefit aggregate productivity by fostering human capital accumulation. To study this equity-efficiency tradeoff, I develop a tractable model of learning across space. Heterogeneous workers learn by interacting with the other individuals in their city. Learning opportunities vary across space as workers sort into cities. Cities affect the stock of human capital by determining the frequency at which workers meet. I show that the tradeoff between productivity and spatial inequality hinges upon the shape of learning complementarities. I estimate the model on French administrative data. I recover learning complementarities from a local projection of future wages on present wages and the wages of nearby individuals. I find that workers employed in relatively skill-dense cities experience faster wage growth, in particular if they are skilled. I address endogeneity concerns by using skill-density variations within firms across neighborhoods driven by past productivity shocks. The model explains two-thirds of the between-city wage growth variance, and gives rise to a steep tradeoff between aggregate human capital accumulation and spatial inequality. I assess the implications of this tradeoff for the general equilibrium effects of moving vouchers. I find that large vouchers are effective at reducing spatial disparities in learning opportunities at the cost of decreased aggregate efficiency. </h6><br> -->

    <h6>We perform the first mapping of the ideological positions of European parties using generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a “zero-shot” learner. We ask OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3.5) to identify the more “right-wing” option across all possible duplets of European parties at a given point in time, solely based on their names and country of origin. Following Wu et al. (2023), we combine this information via a Bradley-Terry decomposition to create an ideological ranking. A comparison of our LLM-generated assessment with widely-used expert-, manifesto- and survey-based measures reveals that Large Language Models (LLMs) may provide a reliable, cost- and time-effective option for researchers to map the evolution of parties' ideological stand in real-time.</h6>
